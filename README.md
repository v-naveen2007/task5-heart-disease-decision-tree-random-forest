Steps Performed:

1. Loaded dataset (Breast Cancer from sklearn).
2. Trained a Decision Tree classifier and visualized it.
3. Trained a Random Forest classifier and compared accuracy.
4. Interpreted feature importance.
5. Evaluated models using cross-validation.

Results:

1)Decision Tree Accuracy: ~0.90
2)Random Forest Accuracy: ~0.95
3)Random Forest reduced overfitting and gave better generalization.
